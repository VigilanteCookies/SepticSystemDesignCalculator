# SepticSystemDesignCalculator
This is code for a Septic System Design Calculator for New York State. This is the first project I've made and posted in python.
This has also been my first time using gethub so excuse any errors

This calculator can be used to quickly estimate area needed for a septic system.
Ive included Sand filters, Eljen Mats, Infiltrators, and typical Gravel Trenches as well.
Use at your own risk of course but you can check and even tweek the code your self, its a simple program.
I might add a GUI in the future and if i do id probably like to show drawings so the code would get alot more complicated.

How to run the code
  To use this simply have python downloaded and open using python.
  You could copy paste the code itself into a word document, rename the extention to ".py" and run it that way.
  I will be working on making this an independant application if I add more features.
  That should be it.

If you dont design septic systems for a living then heres a quick rundown...
  The size of the septic is based off of the bedroom count
  Having a hot tub or garbage disposal adds the equivilent of 1 bedroom
  After you pick what type of system the readout at the end is what the Health Department needs to see along with a sketch to 
  approve of the septic system.
  Dont get too excited because it would also need to be stamped by a PE (Profesional Engineer)
  
Application Rate.(Note: not used in sandfilters)
  To get the correct application rate you will need to do a perc test.
  To do a perc test go to the site where you you want the septic.
  Dig a hole 1'ft in diameter and greater than 8"inches but probably less than 30"inches down. 
  You want the bottom of the hole to be the bottom of the trench, however deep you want the trench to be. (Topsoil tends to perc. much better)
  Get a stick and mark 5"inches and 6"inches as visably as possible so you can easily see when in the hole. 
  Put water in the hole up to the 6" mark and start a timer.
  When the water level reaches the 5"inch mark stop the timer, write down the time, refil the hole with water to the 6"inch mark and restart the timer.
  When the time results are within 1 minute of eachother then you can stop. (If it percs quickly to start cycle it 3 times minimum. 
  If it takes more than an hour stop testing the hole because the soil did not perc. do a sand filter or eljen mat system instead)
  That should get you in the ball park. Dont be afraid to do mutiple tests. Try and keep them 20'ft apart minimum 
  Once you have your perc times take the longest one and use the chart in the code to find the application rate.
  
  One last thing is a deep hole test can be usefull for finding hiden veins of sand or gravel deeper down which can reduce septic size and cost.
