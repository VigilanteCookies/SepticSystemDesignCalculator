# Septic System Design Tool
# This is meant to be the single tool and resource needed to fully design a septic system.

# Planning:
# Start up- play intro animation or graphic
# Replacement system?-purpose to determine fixtures for GPD Rate -- add note describing purpose and reasoning
# if yes allow a select from chart values to select GPD Rate -- if no continue with auto selected 110 rate
# ask number of- bedrooms, hot tubs, and garbage disposals
# application rate set with option to skip
# ask if ETU will be used

# Provide a design readout with as much info as possible for each system
# (Advanced- draw a graph of each system details for comparison)
# (Advanced- draw a sketch of each system defaulting to the longest trench length allowed then
# ask if you want to adjust maximum values (smaller) to change dimensions of the system
# if no continue -- if yes ask length and width dimensions with max values shown to be inputted as an unchanged value)

# Select system and print System Design readout, construction notes, and component details.

# Ask if pump is needed
# if yes ask head high, pump pipe length and diameter, and distribution pipe length and diameter
# Then calc. volume needed then calc. tank elevations for floats
# Re-Print System Design readout, construction notes, and component details.
